Hi Mam,

My name is Kunal Appa.I worked on Tobacco dataset.

Information about dataset : The tobaco.csv dataset can be used to analyze the demographic characteristics of smokers and types of tobacco consumed. It can also be used to explore the relationship between smoking and other factors.

The tobaco.csv dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and students who are interested in studying smoking behavior. It is also a useful dataset for data scientists who are interested in developing models to predict smoking behavior.

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("tobacco.csv")

"""The tobacco.csv dataset contains the prevalence and trends of tobacco use for 1995-2010. The data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The BRFSS is a telephone survey that collects data on health-related behaviors and chronic diseases from adults in the United States.

The tobacco.csv dataset includes the following variables:

Year: The year of the survey.
State: The state in which the survey respondent resides.
Smoke everyday: The percentage of survey respondents who smoke cigarettes every day.
Smoke some days: The percentage of survey respondents who smoke cigarettes some days but not every day.
Former smoker: The percentage of survey respondents who used to smoke cigarettes but no longer do.
Never smoked: The percentage of survey respondents who have never smoked cigarettes.
Location 1: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the survey respondent's home.
